The standard option `trim_trailing_white_space_on_save` works well, but I wanted only half of its functionality.  
What it does is emptying lines only containing whitespace, as well as removing any trailing whitespace.

What this plugin does is the former; emptying lines only containing whitespace.  
You can enable this through the preferences (or syntax-specific) like so:

{
	"strip_whitespace_lines_on_save": true,
}
